#### 1.1  Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques.
---


• [**Phishing**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/phishing-5/)  - is a type of cyberattack that uses email, phone or text to entice individuals into providing personal or sensitive information, ranging from passwords, credit card information and social security numbers to details about a person or organization.

• Smishing - Combine SMS with phishing and you have the technique called smishing. With smishing, attackers send fraudulent text messages in an attempt to gather information like credit card numbers or passwords.

• Vishing  - Combine VoIP with phishing and you get vishing. This type of phishing involves calls from a fraudulent person attempting to obtain sensitive information.

• [**Spam**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/spam-3/) - is usually defined as unsolicited commercial e-mail, often from someone trying to sell something.

• Spam over instant messaging (SPIM) - Another very common type of spam is spim. This is unsolicited instant messaging. This is when you pop open your IM and suddenly you’re getting messages all over the place.

• Spear phishing - Spear phishing is particularly targeted as attackers take time to gather details that they can use to present themselves as trusted entities. They then construct personalized phishing emails, including details that make it seem as though the email is coming from a friendly source.

• [**Dumpster diving**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/dumpster-diving-4/)  -  is going into a person or business' trash bin to look for information that normally would not be available that can be used to attack a computer network.

• [**Shoulder surfing**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/shoulder-surfing-4/) - one of the ways that attackers are able to gather details is by simply looking over your shoulder.

• Pharming  -  is an online scam similar to phishing, where a website's traffic is manipulated, and confidential information is stolen. In essence, it is the criminal act of producing a fake website and then redirecting users to it.

• [**Tailgating**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/other-social-engineering-attacks/) -  technique where somebody uses someone else to gain access to a locked area, restricted area, or perhaps a building. You see this often if somebody badges in that someone walks right behind them without badging in, that is a case of tailgating. 

• Eliciting information - technique for the social engineering attacker is their ability to pretend to be someone they aren’t or impersonation. Once the attacker has the victim at ease, they can start extracting information very easily from that person.

• Whaling - is a specific type of phishing attack that targets high-profile employees, such as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer, in order to steal sensitive information from a company. In many whaling phishing attacks, the attacker's goal is to manipulate the victim into authorizing high-value wire transfers to the attacker.

• Prepending - adding a code to beginning of a presumably safe file or domain. It’s all spelled correctly except for the additional text at the beginning.

• Identity fraud - impersonation to gain access and information.

• Invoice scams  - is when the attacker has done the work to figure out who pays the invoices in your organization, and they send an invoice directly to that person with a bill that needs to be paid.

• Credential harvesting - attempt to trick users into entering their credentials into a fraudulent website to steal their login information. After entering the credentials, the user is often redirected to a legitimate webpage.

• Reconnaissance - type of security attack that an attacker uses to gather all possible information about the target before launching an actual attack. An attacker uses a reconnaissance attack as a preparation tool for an actual attack.

• [**Hoaxes**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/hoaxes-4/)  - hoax is a message, often circulated through email, that tells of impending doom from a virus or other security threat that simply doesn’t exist. Users may be encouraged to delete files or change their system configuration.

• [**Impersonation**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/impersonation-3/) - a technique that attacker is pretending to be someone inside the organization. And this doesn’t have to be in person, it could simply be over the phone. People who are very good at impersonation will try to find out as much information as they can about your organization.

• [**Watering hole attack**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/watering-hole-attacks-2/) - when users inside the organization visit themselves an third party website setup by the attacker.

• Typosquatting - is a type of social engineering attack which targets internet users who incorrectly type a URL into their web browser rather than using a search engine. Typically, it involves tricking users into visiting malicious websites with URLs that are common misspellings of legitimate websites.

• Pretexting - This tactic is one more commonly associated with the term social engineering. With pretexting, an individual impersonates a representative from a trusted organization with the goal of acquiring sensitive information. This social engineering technique relies heavily on gathering research before initiating contact with the target.

• [**Influence campaigns**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/influence-campaigns/) - sway public opinion on political and social issues

    - Hybrid warfare  - military strategy
                      - cyberwarfare
    - Social media    - fake accounts/users
                      - fake content on social media to amplify the message
                      - mass media picks up the story
                    
• [**Principles (reasons for effectiveness)**](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/principles-of-social-engineering-2/)

    - Authority - social engineer is in charge 
    - Intimidation - there will be bad things if you don't help 
    - Consensus/Social Proof  - concinve based on what's normally expected 
    - Scarcity  - the situation will not be this way for long; must make the change before time expires
    - Familiarity/Liking -   someone you know, we have common friends
    - Trust - someone who is safe; I'm from IT and I'm here to help
    - Urgency - works alongside scarcity; act quickly, don't think
